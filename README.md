# Portfolio Website

A minimal and responsive personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, experience, and projects in web development.

## Getting Started

This website is built using Astro, a modern static site builder. To run it locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bddGonzalez/presentation-page.git
    cd presentation-page
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**

    Using npm:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Astro development server, and you can view the website in your browser at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Features

This portfolio website includes the following sections:

- **Homepage:** A brief introduction about me and my key skills.
- **Resume:** A detailed overview of my professional experience and education.

The design is intentionally minimal and responsive, focusing on clear and easy navigation across different devices.
